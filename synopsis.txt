01 - CustomerService in Javascript
  * insert({ name: 'customer01' });
    * missing id error
  * insert({ id: 123, name: 'customer02' });
    * seems to work
    * maybe id should be string?
  * insert({ id: 'abc', name: 'customer02' });
    * hmm, also working
  * insert(customer, authToken)
    * no compile time errors
02 - getting started with Typescript
03 - copy 01.js to 03.ts
  * tsc --> works fine
  * Add patameter type --> customer: Customer
  * create interface Customer { id: number; name: string }
  * all of a sudden: distinct compile time errors
  * Customer.address? --> ? makes it optional
  * remove call that doesn't have any id
  * how to run it? > tsc && node dist/03.js
